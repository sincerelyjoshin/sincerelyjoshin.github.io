### **Here, in no particular order, are my top 3 recommended vidoes from the conference:**  

***[Automating Yourself Out Of a Job with Chef](https://youtu.be/qlIrFPUc1vk) with Joseph Chilcote:***  
These talks from Nate or Mike of the FaceBook CPE team always end up being some of my favorites. This time around it was Joe Chilcote presenting which was a nice change of pace. Joe went into some detail about chef-client passes and how the FaceBook CPE team utilizes that to layer overrides from a base/template state to a more granular state that is user customizable via an API. He also showed off his new CPE_Nomad cookbook that I can't wait to get my hands on.

***[Imaging is Dead: What Now?](https://youtu.be/0j4AxqkwQG4) with Greg Neagle:***  
When Greg speaks, we listen... Subject matter includes various imaging techniques, first and third-party tools in the imaging process, complications of APFS and Secure Boot, and Apple's push towards the macOS installer. **Make sure to stick around for the post-credits scene!**

***[Curing Operating System Blindness](https://youtu.be/n_gZFxvnj9k) with Graham Gilbert and Brett Demetris:***  
Graham and Brett share their story about how they (eventually) embraced Windows into their environment. You don't get to see this very often at an Apple centric conference and it was a breathe of fresh air to see how fellow MacAdmins; who are used to tools like Munki, Puppet or Chef, MDM, and Sal visualize managing Windows.
